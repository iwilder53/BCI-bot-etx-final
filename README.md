# BCI-bot-etx-final

final year project for an engineering student

all of this code is to control a basic bot with brain waves over bluetooth


#This is split in two parts : 
 the bci.ino file is for controlling the bot
 
 and the other folder contails the visual studio stuff for the ui and actual sensing of brain waves
